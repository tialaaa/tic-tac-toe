# Tic-Tac-Toe: Fire vs Ice

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application brings a digital refresh to the classic game Tic Tac Toe. Using competitors Fire and Ice, this app allows two players to compete in unlimited game rounds and track their total wins over time.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
To use this application:
- Open the repo in Github: https://github.com/tialaaa/tic-tac-toe
- Use the terminal to clone the repository to your local machine
- Navigate into the project directory
- Run the command `open index.html` to open the app in your browser

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
Completed over six days, this was my final project of module 1 at the Turing School.

### Contributors:

Solo project by Tiala Young: [GitHub](https://github.com/tialaaa), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tialayoung/)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Solidify and demonstrate understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use problem solving process to break down large problems and solve them step by step

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
As the final project of my first inning at Turing, this project was a culmination of my first five weeks of learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. With a solid understanding of the foundations by this point, I used this project to further practice separating the data model from the DOM. To do so, I worked on the data model first until the game was fully playable using only the console, without any user interface. Once the game model was functional and thoroughly tested, I added DOM functionality and event delegation to the game board and linked it all to the data model. This was great practice and furthered my understanding of why and how these pieces should operate independently. Additionally, I used this project to explore new topics, such as persistent storage of the players' scores using `localStorage` and CSS animations to celebrate the winning player.
